Canberra latest bus times with NXTBUS API

This is a proof of concept personal project where I test pulling data from the [NXTBUS SIRI API](https://www.transport.act.gov.au/getting-around/bus-services/mobile-apps) and present it to the user.

The live version of this code is running on a [Heroku](https://mighty-journey-31411.herokuapp.com/) server.

# Todo
